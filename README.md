# 🚀 Razorpay DevOps Project-1

## 📌 Introduction

This project demonstrates a production-style CI/CD pipeline for a Dockerized web application deployed on AWS EC2.

The objective of this project is to:

- Containerize a web application using Docker
- Automate image building using GitHub Actions
- Push images to Docker Hub
- Deploy automatically to an AWS EC2 instance
- Implement secure SSH-based deployment
- Replace containers automatically on every push

This simulates a real-world DevOps workflow used in modern engineering teams.
